When trying to run the tests here type 

> go test -v ./ho 
=== RUN   TestAddQue
--- PASS: TestAddQue (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestNext
--- PASS: TestNext (0.00s)
PASS
ok      20testing/ho    (cached)

--- 

You were getting errors when you typed 
> go test -v ho/ho-test.go 
# command-line-arguments [command-line-arguments.test]
ho/ho_test.go:14:7: undefined: New
ho/ho_test.go:32:7: undefined: New
FAIL    command-line-arguments [build failed]
FAIL
>> Problem here is that it couldnt see the ho.go file 
so the above method puts it into scope

There is also yet another method you can execute the test 
> go into the directory wih the foo.go and foo_test.go 
> go test -v 
- This will execute all the tests without have to describe the paths
